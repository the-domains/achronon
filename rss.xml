            <title><![CDATA[You become what you hate]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>You become what you hate</h1><p>This is a special time of year in many regards. We're between holidays that are not so important anymore and perhaps the biggest American holiday and the universally Christian holiday of Christmas which is right around the corner. It is fitting, I think, that these all occur when they do, here at the end of the solar year, after the harvest, and in preparation for the retreat before the winter. This is a time of turning inward -- or it should be -- a time of reflection upon who we are, what we believe, and what we are doing.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>An iceberg sunk the Titanic, and it could happen to us</h1><p>The thing about icebergs is you can't see most of what they are, but they're there anyway. The thing about prejudices is that you don't know where they come from, but they're there anyway. The thing about stereotypes is that you don't know why you believe them, but you believe them anyway. The thing about myths is that you don't know where they come from, but you believe them anyway as well. Just like we don't know how to account for 75% of the mass of the visible universe, we can't account for the motivations for most of what we believe and what makes us act the way we do.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How does a "we" become a "me"?</h1><p>Although it has been a while, I've dealt with the notion of "Advent", what it's about, how it not only marks a change of seasons, but also what it means in a yearly sense. </p></article>]]></description>
